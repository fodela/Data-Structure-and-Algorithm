## Graphs

Are more general structure than trees. We can think of a tree as a special kind of graph.

Can be used to represent many real world things such as systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the internet is connected, etc.

Can be used to solve very difficult problems.

### Terminologies

**Vertex** (**Node**) => fundamental part of a graph.

- It can have a name (key).
- Can have additional information (payload)

**Edge**
An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them.
Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph are all one-way, we say the graph is a **directed graph**, or a **digraph**.

**Weight**
Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities.
