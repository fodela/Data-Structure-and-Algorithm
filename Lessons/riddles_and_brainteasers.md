## Riddles and Brainteasers

Many companies, including Google and Microsoft, have policies banning brain teasers, however some interviewers still sometimes ask these tricky questions.

Various Types:

- Trick Questions
  - Need prior knowledge
- Estimation Problems
  - How many people log in to gmail daily?
- Math Puzzles
  - Logic in computer science

### Approach

- Don't panic when you get a brain teaser. Interviewers want to see how you tackle a problem.
- They don't expect you to immediately know the answer.
- Start talking, and show the interviewer how you approach a problem.
- In many cases, you will also find that the brain teasers have some connection back to fundamental laws or theories of computer science (Data Structure and Algorithms). If you are stuck, it's recommended to try simplify the problem.
- Solve it for a small number of items or a special case, and then see if you can generalize it.
- Remember to check if you can relate the problem to a fundamental data structure or algorithm.
- Break down the problems.

**All the best**
