### Problem Statement

You are in a hallway with 100 lockers. You start with one pass and open the lockers, so that the opened lockers are now with their doors opened out. You begin by closing every second locker. Then you go to toggle every third locker (close every third locker and close it if it is open). You continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n. After your hundredth pass of the hallway, in which you toggle only locker number 100, how many lockers are open?
